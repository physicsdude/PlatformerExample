# Programming

## Why are you interested in Programming?

## What is Programming?

- Telling computers what to do.

- This sounds easy, is it?

## Make me a Peanut Butter and Jelly sandwich!

- Write out instructions to tell a robot how to make you a sandwich

- Take 1-2 minutes

- Watch Harvard Computer Science 50 Class 0 with Professor David Milan on iTunes at about 25 minute point
  (I recommend you watch as many of these lectures as you can ... it's like going to Harvard for Free :) )

- What could you improve about your instructions?

## What's a variable?

- A variable in computer programming is a way to store information and change what information is stored.

- Example variable name (perl): 

my $bread_count = 0;

## What's a function?

- A function is a wrapper around a set of instructions.  This is a lot more useful than it sounds.

- Example function name (perl): 

sub applyPeanutButter {
	my ($amount,$to) = @_;
}

## What's an Algorithm?

- "In mathematics and computer science, an algorithm is a step-by-step procedure for calculations. Algorithms are used for calculation, data processing, and automated reasoning." - Wikipedia

- Some are more based on "logic" and don't involve much math, some are very mathematical

## Search Algorithms

- How would you search for a name in a Phone Book?

## How to Make Your Own Computer and Phone Based Games

- There are many programs for this - try GameSalad

- "Scratch" is often used and is good for learning logic, but you'll become frustrated quickly if you want to make a game

- Unity3D

## Platformer Example

- Open GameSalad Platformer Example ...

## Sorting Algorithms

- Bubble sort
